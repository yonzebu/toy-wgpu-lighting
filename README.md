# toy-wgpu-renderer

A very simple wgpu-based renderer. While the goal was originally to implement the basics and use it as a platform to experiment with lighting effects and, more generally, arbitrary shader effects, I still haven't really gotten as far past the basics as I would like, and the project still is rather unorganized and very unstable. It should support web builds, although I'm not sure how to use the web builds without creating a small local server (e.g. with `python -m http.server`) because I'm not particularly experienced with any sort of web development and wasn't particularly focused on making this usable for other people before I felt it was reasonably interesting.
